We have applied LxN__Lungs-X-Ray-Neural-Network-Model (Which is present in the LxN repo of this organization) for covid detection with the accuracy of 98% and published a research paper "Predictive Analysis for the Detection of Covid-19 with Chest X-Ray Images Using Convolutional Neural Network" on that. Complete code and Paper can be found in this repo.
